```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind's gradient utility classes. However, if the `to-purple-500` class is not defined in your theme configuration, it might result in unexpected behavior or rendering issues.
